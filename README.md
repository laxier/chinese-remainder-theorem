uni project so it's russian
This software is designed for students to independently study the algorithm of the Chinese remainder theorem. It can be used by students of technical universities when studying RSA public key code. Using the Chinese remainder theorem in RSA algorithms allows you to increase the decryption speed up to 4 times.
The Chinese Remnant Theorem was founded in China by ancient people as early as the 3rd century. Later, Suanjing did more research on the subject, which is why the theorem is also known as Sun Tzu's theorem.
